    "Introduction":"The Main Asteroid Belt is a region located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the Solar System. It consists of numerous small celestial bodies, including asteroids and other rocky fragments. The width of the asteroid belt ranges from approximately 2.2 astronomical units (AU) to 3.2 AU, with 1 AU being the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. The largest object in the asteroid belt is Ceres, which is classified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Other notable asteroids in the belt include Pallas and Vesta. Although referred to as a 'belt', the objects in the asteroid belt are relatively sparse and widely spaced, allowing spacecraft to navigate through the region without significant risk of collision."
